#  Where can one find information on permissible gambling activities in each U.S. state?

Gambling activities are heavily regulated at the state level in the United States. The legality of various forms of gambling varies from state to state, so it is important to know the specific laws in your state before engaging in any form of gambling.

Generally speaking, most forms of gambling are legal in some states and illegal in others. The most common forms of gambling include casino games, lotteries, horse racing, and bingo. There are also a number of more niche types of gambling that are legal in some states but not others, such as dog racing, social gaming, and charity gaming.

One easy way to find information on permissible gambling activities in each U.S. state is to consult an online resource like the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).
