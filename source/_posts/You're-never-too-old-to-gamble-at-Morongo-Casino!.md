## Things to keep in mind

When deciding if gambling is for you, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Gambling can be addictive, so if you have any history of addiction, it's best to stay away. Additionally, gambling can be expensive - in fact, the average person loses more money than they win playing casino games.

Before heading to the casino, make sure you have enough money to cover your losses. It's also a good idea to set a limit on how much you're willing to spend and stick to it. If you find yourself going over that limit, stop gambling and leave the casino.

Finally, remember that gambling is a risky proposition. You could walk away a winner or a loser, so always gamble responsibly.
