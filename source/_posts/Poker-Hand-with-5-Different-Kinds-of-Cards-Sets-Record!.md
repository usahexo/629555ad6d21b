#  Poker player achieves unique hand with 5 different card types

In a recent game of poker, one player achieved an interesting hand with 5 different card types. This is believed to be a unique occurrence in the history of the game.

The player had 2 spades, 2 clubs, and 1 heart. This is a relatively common combination, but the player also had 2 diamonds and 1 king. This made their hand quite unusual and gave them a lot of potential for winning the game.

Since there are only 4 suits in a deck of cards, it is rare to get more than one card of the same suit in a hand. This makes it even more difficult to achieve a hand with 5 different card types.

There were many people watching the game and awaiting the outcome. The player ended up winning the hand, which was greeted by much applause from the spectators.

This event has now been documented in the history of poker as an unusual and impressive feat. It is sure to be remembered by players for years to come.
