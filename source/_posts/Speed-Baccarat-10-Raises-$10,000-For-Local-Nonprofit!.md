#  Speed Baccarat 10 Raises $10,000 For Local Nonprofit!

Speed Baccarat 10 is a new and upcoming charitable event in Las Vegas. This event is set to raise $10,000 for a local nonprofit.

What is Speed Baccarat?

Simply put, Speed Baccarat is an action-packed game that pits players against the dealer in an effort to complete their hand first. In traditional baccarat, each player has the option to either bet on the bank or bet on themselves. However, with speed baccarat, players are only given the opportunity to bet on the bank.

The Goal of Speed Baccarat

The goal of speed baccarat is to draw two cards that total nine or as close to nine as possible. If you draw two eight’s for example, your total would be 16 and would lose to a total of nine. The winner is the first person to reach zero or a total higher than the banker.

Why Play Speed Baccarat?

There are a few reasons why someone might want to play speed baccarat. For one, it’s an incredibly fast-paced game that can be exciting and suspenseful at the same time. Secondly, this game offers some of the best odds in casino gaming. Finally, playing speed baccarat allows players to contribute to a good cause while enjoying themselves at the same time!
