#  Fircrest Fun: Local Arcade Has a Puzzled Slot Machine

I was reading the paper and saw a small article about a local arcade that has a puzzled slot machine. The name of the arcade is Fircrest Fun and it is located in Fircrest, Washington. I decided to check it out and see what it was all about!

As soon as I walked in, I could see the puzzled slot machine right in front of me. It was a bit smaller than average, but it definitely caught my attention. There were a few people playing it, so I decided to give it a try.

The objective of the game is to line up three pieces of the same color to create a match. Once you have created a match, the pieces will disappear and new pieces will fall from the top of the screen. If you get four pieces of the same color in a row, you will earn 4x your bet amount. The game continues until there are no more matches possible or you lose all of your lives.

I have to say, this game is definitely puzzling! It took me a while to even figure out how to play it. But once I got the hang of it, I started to get pretty good at it. I managed to get up to 300x my bet amount before I lost all my lives.

If you’re looking for a fun and puzzling arcade game to play, then be sure to check out Fircrest Fun! They have a wide variety of games to choose from, including the puzzled slot machine.
