<p>He was a regular at the club’s home games at the Estadio Vicente Calderón, and he followed the team all over Europe.</p>
<p>The king even named his son, Fuad, after the team’s most famous player, Fuad I.</p>
<p>Club Atlético Madrid honoured King Farouk by retiring the number 10 shirt in his honour.</p>
<h1 id="King’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Led-to-His-Downfall-and-Ruin-of-Spanish-Football-Club"><a href="#King’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Led-to-His-Downfall-and-Ruin-of-Spanish-Football-Club" class="headerlink" title="King’s Addiction to Gambling Led to His Downfall and Ruin of Spanish Football Club"></a>King’s Addiction to Gambling Led to His Downfall and Ruin of Spanish Football Club</h1><p>King Alfonso XIII of Spain had a gambling addiction that led to the downfall and ruin of Spanish football club Atlético Madrid. The club was founded on 26 April 1903 by three Basque students living in Madrid. The students, Enrique Allende, Federico García and Julio López, were members of the Athletic Bilbao football team from the Basque Country. They were looking for a place to play football in the Spanish capital.</p>
<p>Alfonso XIII, who was a passionate fan of Atlético Madrid, contributed to the club’s early years by donating a piece of land near the Manzanares River and providing financial support. In 1907, King Alfonso himself became president of Atlético Madrid.</p>
<p>However, his love for gambling eventually caused him to lose control of the club. In 1922, he was banned from betting after being caught cheating at cards. This led to him selling his shares in Atlético Madrid to other investors. The club went into decline and was relegated to Second Division in 1933.</p>
<p>In 1941, King Alfonso was forced to abdicate due to political unrest in Spain. His son, Prince Juan Carlos, took over as head of state. One of Juan Carlos’ first acts as king was to restore the royal patronage to Atlético Madrid and help revive the club.</p>
<p>Atlético Madrid eventually regained its place in La Liga and went on to win several league titles and Champions League trophies. However, the club’s debt has continued to grow over the years and it is now facing financial difficulties once again. It is clear that King Alfonso’s addiction to gambling has left a lasting legacy on Atlético Madrid - both positively and negatively</p>
<h1 id="Spanish-Football-Club’s-Former-Owner-Ran-into-Financial-Trouble-with-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Spanish-Football-Club’s-Former-Owner-Ran-into-Financial-Trouble-with-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Spanish Football Club’s Former Owner Ran into Financial Trouble with Gambling Addiction"></a>Spanish Football Club’s Former Owner Ran into Financial Trouble with Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Spanish football club’s former owner has been revealed to have run into financial trouble as a result of his gambling addiction. The now bankrupt individual reportedly lost millions of euros through gambling, which caused his businesses to suffer.</p>
<p>The owner is not the only one to have fallen victim to gambling addiction; according to a study by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, over half a million workers in Europe are addicted to gambling. This number is especially worrying when considering the negative impact that gambling addiction can have on both individuals and their families.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs that can indicate someone has a gambling problem. If someone is experiencing any of the following, it might be worth seeking professional help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing substantial amounts of money despite repeated attempts to win it back</li>
<li>Becoming agitated or defensive when questioned about gambling habits</li>
<li>Missing work or other important commitments due to gambling</li>
<li>Having few friends or social activities outside of gambling</li>
<li>Feeling guilty or ashamed about gambling</li>
<li>Hiding or lying about gambling activity</li>
</ul>

The former owner of the club, Enrique Cerezo, also faced legal troubles after developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Cerezo had been the owner of Atlético Madrid since 2003, but he was forced to sell his shares in the team after his gambling addiction began to take its toll. In April 2018, Cerezo was arrested for allegedly defrauding a casino out of €500,000.</p>
<p>The former owner’s legal troubles didn’t end there, though. In June 2018, Cerezo and two other executives from Atlético Madrid were indicted on charges of tax fraud. The three men were accused of failing to declare €1.5 million in taxable income between 2011 and 2016.</p>
<p>As a result of these legal troubles, Cerezo has stepped down from his role as president of Atlético Madrid. He has also sold his shares in the team, bringing an end to his more than 15-year tenure as owner of the club.</p>

Allegations detailed the former king’s visits to casinos in Madrid, Marbella, and Geneva on a regular basis. The former king had allegedly lost millions of dollars in these casinos. While the monarchy attempted to keep these allegations under wraps, they eventually became public knowledge and led to Juan Carlos’ abdication in 2014. In addition to his gambling addiction, the former king’s multiple affairs also tarnished his reputation.</p>
