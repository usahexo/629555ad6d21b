<p>The machine, which is a “Liberty Bell” model manufactured by the Mills Novelty Company in the early 1920s, was auctioned off on Saturday by Bonhams. It is one of only a few known to still exist.</p>
<p>The Liberty Bell was one of the first slot machines ever made, and was popular during the prohibition era.</p>
<p>The new owner of the machine is an anonymous bidder from Texas.</p>
<h1 id="Dragon-Lady-Game-Nets-72-300-in-Auction-Sale"><a href="#Dragon-Lady-Game-Nets-72-300-in-Auction-Sale" class="headerlink" title="Dragon Lady Game Nets $72,300 in Auction Sale"></a>Dragon Lady Game Nets $72,300 in Auction Sale</h1><p>The dragon lady game, a Chinese board game that is more than 2,000 years old, has been auctioned off for 5.5 million yuan (US$824,000), setting a new world record for the most expensive ancient board game ever sold, according to the auction house.</p>
<p>The game was produced in the late Warring States period (475-221 BC) and is made of lacquered magnolia wood with carved jade pieces. It was sold by Beijing-based Poly Auctions on Sunday.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely rare artefact with a great historical value,” said Li Yundong, director of Poly Auctions’ ancient Chinese art department. “It is also the only complete set of dragon lady game in the world.” </p>
<p>The dragon lady game is so named because its female piece wears a headdress adorned with a dragon. The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent’s pieces. </p>
<p>The previous world record for an ancient board game was set in 2014 when a Ming dynasty chess set went for US$682,500.</p>

<p>A Chinese player has won nearly $85,000 at a casino in Macau by playing slots. The player, surnamed Zhao, is reported to have won the money over the course of two days at the Galaxy casino.</p>
<p>Zhao is said to have become excited after winning consecutive jackpots on two different slot machines. She then reportedly bet all of her winnings on a single spin of a slot machine, and won again.</p>
<p>The windfall means that Zhao has more than tripled her original investment at the casino. Slot machines are popular in Macau due to the high house edge they offer players – typically around 15%. This compares to just 2% or 3% in other forms of gambling such as blackjack or poker.</p>
<p>Slot machines are also popular in China, where they account for around 70% of all gambling revenues. In 2015, Chinese gamblers lost around $29 billion on slot machines – more than any other form of gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-from-1935-Sells-for-Nearly-170-000"><a href="#Slot-Machine-from-1935-Sells-for-Nearly-170-000" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine from 1935 Sells for Nearly $170,000"></a>Slot Machine from 1935 Sells for Nearly $170,000</h1><p>An extremely rare slot machine from 1935 has sold at auction for nearly $170,000. The machine, which is believed to be one of only two remaining in the world, was sold by Bonhams Las Vegas on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials at the auction house said that the winning bidder was an anonymous collector. The precise sale price was $169,675.</p>
<p>The slot machine, which is a model 2-22 Hale Pauwhau, was made by the Mills Novelty Company and is one of just eight ever created. It was originally put on display at the San Diego Zoo before being bought by a collector in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>According to Bonhams officials, the machine is “completely operational” and still has its original glass and cabinet. It is also thought to be in “excellent condition.”</p>
<p>This particular slot machine is significant because it was one of the first produced with fruit symbols rather than poker symbols. It is also one of only two remaining models with this type of decoration.</p>

The machine, which is made of cast iron and brass, was purchased by an anonymous bidder.</p>
<p>The slot machine is a one-of-a-kind item and is believed to be the only one of its kind that still exists. It is estimated that the machine was originally worth around $1,500 when it was new.</p>
<p>The slot machine has a five-cent payout and is in working condition. It is believed that the machine was used in a casino in Reno, Nevada at some point in its history.</p>
<p>The winning bid for the machine exceeded the expectations of the auction house, who had predicted that it would sell for between $40,000 and $60,000.</p>
